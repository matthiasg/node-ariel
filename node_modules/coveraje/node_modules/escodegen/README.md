Escodegen ([escodegen](http://github.com/Constellation/escodegen)) is
[ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
(also popularly known as [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>JavaScript))
code generator from [Parser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API) AST.

Escodegen can be used in a web browser:

    <script src="escodegen.js"></script>

or in a Node.js application via the package manager:

    npm install escodegen


simple example:

    escodegen.generate({
        type: 'BinaryExpression',
        operator: '+',
        left: { type: 'Literal', value: 40 },
        right: { type: 'Literal', value: 2 }
    });

and gets following string

    40 + 2
