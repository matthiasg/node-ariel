Ariel
=====
As in 'The Tempest' [Ariel][w] is a the magicians eyes and ears, dutifully watching code and listening to coverage going up and down.

Other tools that might come in handy
====================================

[Growl][g] ([Windows][gw]) with [Risor][gr] installed is very helpful. I like Risor because i find it more apparent and yet unobtrusive than getting a similiar bar from the top :). Dont forget to install [growlnotify][gn] on windows (i also put it into dev-tools though.)
